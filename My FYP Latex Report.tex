\begin{abstract}
  Applying a substance such as oil or grease to an engine or other machinery such that to reduce friction and allow smooth movement is known as Lubrication. The difference between one lubricating material and another is often the difference between successful operation of a machine and failure. Modern machinery, engines and other equipment must be lubricated in order to prolong their lifetime. We are working on an Oil Hydraulic and lubrication bench that is used for the lubrication and hydraulic test of an engine. This machine or test bench was not working correctly due to some reasons. The machine was not functioning automatically, the oil which was used for lubrication should be heated up to a specific temperature range therefore the oil temperature must not pass the required temperature range therefore its temperature needed to be controlled, and there was also difficulty in taking readings on the analogue temperature gauge. We are going to upgrade the temperature sensor and temperature gauge. We have also proposed a solution for controlling the temperature of the oil furnace. After the completion of this project the machine will operate at desired level of temperature. And it will thus work properly and automatically.

\chapter{\textbf{Introduction}}

In this project we are working on an industrial machine which is used for the Lubrication and hydraulic
test of an engine. This machine is malfunctioned due to some reasons, thus we are going to upgrade and
make it working. There are few problems and diﬃculties in operating this Oil Hydraulic machine.

\section{\textbf{ Motivation}}

In our country there is a very lack of development we are very behind in the race of technology from
all the developed countries. Thus no one focuses on the ease of an individual and delivering easiness to
the labours and workers in an industry. Thus we want to upgrade the present machine from analogue
to digital, and provide automation of the machine so one can operate is easily. As well as digitalization
provides accuracy of data reading.

\section{\textbf{Objective}}

The main goal of the project is to
\begin{itemize}
  \item Digitization and Up-gradation of the thermostat sensor
  \item Digitization and Up-gradation of the temperature gauge (panel)
  \item We want to control the temperature of the oil heater of the machine would not heat the oil from beyond the desired (set) limit
  \item We will decide to use either a sensor, Arduino or a PID Controller for controlling the temperature
\end{itemize}

\section{\textbf{Methodology}}
    
For performing this project ﬁrst of all we would do research the literature for this project, and will
try to run the machine in the present condition so that we can contemplate the existing fault and
problem, afterward we will do online research for selecting a valid and appropriate sensor and temperature
controller that must be eﬃcient and reliable as well. Then by selecting a valid sensor we will do schematic
implementation on a software to check if the sensor is valid for our system or not. The next step will be
the hardware implementation, which is very interesting. We will add the sensor in the system and will
do voltage transformation of the sensor by adding a step-up transformer as the machine is 3-phase AC
machine. Then we will dry run the sensor and check the output on a Bulb or LED, etc., instead of the
system. Which is a safety precaution for our machine. Thus by checking the output if it was valid then
we will connect the sensor with the system and will run the machine and check the output.

\section{\textbf{Organization of Report}}

The design explains the architecture of the whole machine and block diagrams of the machine. In the end,
this chapter gives detailed information for each module, explaining their critical methods and properties
required for successful execution.

Chapter 5 explains the approach taken and issues confronted while implementing the intended goals.
It explains the temporal stages experienced while implementing the design, and also the key functions that
needs special consideration from the viewpoint of implementation. In the end, the author has explained
the synchronization of the upgraded sensors with the machine, and the details of each component how it
is handled and used.

The testing and evaluation of the implemented sensors and software schematic is discussed in Chapter
6. It explains the testing procedure followed and then the various types of tests executed on the application
to conﬁrm its proper functioning and meeting the acceptance criteria. The results of these tests are
summarized in the end, with possible results concluded from these tests [2]. In the end, we brieﬂy present
the conclusions from this project and also the possible future improvements and additions for better
design/implementation and investigation of the given test bench.

\chapter{\textbf{Literature Review}}
\section{\textbf{Literature Review}}

We need to lubricate the moving parts of an engine, which are constantly in friction. It thus reduces
friction which, if left unchecked, tends to increase part wear. The energy lost through combustion and
the friction between mechanical parts causes the engine temperature to rise. Lubrication provided by the
engine oil helps to partly address the heat through the lubrication circuit. It supplements the coolant,
which can only cool certain parts of the engine. Microscopic deposits build up in the engine and remain
in suspension. They can consist of dust or combustion residue. Without Lubrication, the residue would
clog the engine and decrease its performance. The lubrication, after certain time continuously causes
to increase the engine life. There are thesis and details about lubrication and engine oil in the given
references. We have searched online about the lubrication system and diﬀerent sensors which are going
to be used in the up-gradation of our test bench shown in figure~\ref{fig:Figure1}.[1]

\end{figure}

We have searched diﬀerent thermostats, thermocouples, temperature controllers, PID Controllers,
switches, Relays for this purpose. We have contacted diﬀerent online sellers and learnt about the com
ponents and sensors that are needed for our project.[2]

\chapter{\textbf{Requirements Specification}}

In our project we are going to Digitize and Upgrade the Lubrication and Oil Hydraulic Bench. This project
requires to change the analog gauge to the digital gauge in order to get better results and accuracy. And
we have to stop the heater of the oil hydraulic Bench. The requirements for this particular are temperature
controllers, PID Controllers, switches, Relays for controlling temperature. In the ﬁrst step we did our
background search on this project. The second step is to build hardware and do troubleshooting to
remove any errors.

The Non-functional and Functional Requirements are categorized into various groups based on rela
tions and objective of requirements.

\newpage

\chapter{\textbf{Implementation}}

We have implemented the suggested design using the development stages given below

\section{\textbf{Development Stages}}

Following were the discrete phases we have experienced incrementally to realize our product in the given time:

\subsection{\textbf{Creating Schematic and Simulation}}

We first of all implemented the project on the Matlab Simulink software to visualize the process schematically. We found the solution about how we are going to implement the whole system. We generated a block diagram of the whole process using Simulink. 

\subsection{\textbf{Installing Temperature sensor}}

We made a frame and installed all the components i.e. PID controller, switches, thermocouple, heat sink, relay etc. Then we run the system and checked the output, all the components were functioning correctly. This was the module including all the major components of our project.

\subsection{\textbf{Synchronizing the system}}

We then presented our module to the HIT and asked permission to synchronize our module with the test bench. Therefore we got permission and HIT allowed us to connect our module with the machine. Therefore with the help of their one staff member we connected our module with the machine.


\subsection{\textbf{Running the machine with new system}}

As we already described, machine was depending on our PID module and could not be unit-tested without communicating to them properly. After connecting both systems together we started the machine and set the temperature on PID controller. The heating process of the oil started and the feedback from the temperature sensor comes to the input of PID controller. As the required set point of the heating process reached the PID switched off the heater from further heating by giving pulse to relay.

\section{\textbf{System Integration}}

The next step followed was to integrate everything together. All stages discussed above to be combined and constitute a single product. The external module was connected with the test bench (Machine). And all the connection were made, and project was ready to execute as discussed above.

\subsection{\textbf{PID Controller}}

We used PID Controller REX-C700. Which is the core of our project as it is used on industry level so we need a strong and perfect quality component because in industries the machines and modules are used on daily basis therefore we choose a pre-programmed PID Controller as shown in the figure (design description). 

\vspace{3mm}

There are inputs and outputs for AC voltage, thermocouple, relay and Alarm. There are buttons on front panel for changing values, modes, and calibrating the temperature sensor and PID Controller. We also included the user interface for the self-alignment of the PID controller manually. PID controller is show in figure~\ref{fig:figure5}

\section{\textbf{User Interface}}

User Interface is an extremely important consideration for any project that requires human-machine interaction. However, this project doesn’t require human machine interaction and therefore the PID runs solely in the background without any user interference. Besides this fact, there are also options to display the current temperature, calibrate the sensor, and select many modes of operation from the front panel of PID controller. The user interface is shown below ~\ref{fig:figure7}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{centering}    
    \includegraphics[width = 5 in]
  {figure7.jpg}
    \caption{User Interface}
    \label{fig:figure7}       % Give a unique label
  \end{centering}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\chapter{\textbf{Evaluation}}

We have focused on thorough testing through-out the design and implementation phase. While testing the project we adopted two methods. First unit testing and then function testing.

\section{\textbf{Unit Testing}}

In unit testing phase we tested the whole PID controller circuit and components. The circuit starts operating and we were able to visualize the temperature which is sensed by the thermocouple. We then calibrated the thermocouple sensor with the actual temperature through physical (analogue) thermometer. Then we checked the thermocouple and working of the relay by changing the temperature of a simple bucket of water and visualize the results.

\section{\textbf{Function Testing}}

When we integrated the system with the test bench (machine). Both systems together started working together. The thermocouple sensor was dipped in the oil Heater reservoir to visualize the changing temperature of the oil. As the heating process of the oil starts and the pulse from the temperature sensor starts coming to the input of PID controller. And at the required set point on the PID controller, the PID gives pulse to relay and the relay switches off the heater and oil doesn’t heats beyond the limit.  

\subsection{\textbf{Testing Requirements }}

Table \ref{table:6.1} shows the testing of the project in cycles.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | }
\hline
 Requirements Tested & CYCLE 1 & CYCLE 2 & Final Status \\ 
\hline
 FR-01-001 & OK & OK & OK \\

 FR-01-002 & FAILED & OK & OK \\
\hline
FR-01-003& OK & OK & OK \\

FR-01-005 & OK & OK & OK \\  
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Testing Requirements}
\label{table:6.1}
\end{table}

\section{\textbf{Results}}

Following is the simulation of the PID controller along with the system ~\ref{fig:figure8}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{centering}    
    \includegraphics[width = 7 in]
  {figure8.jpg}
    \caption{ simulation of the PID controller}
    \label{fig:figure8}       % Give a unique label
  \end{centering}
\end{figure}

We set the temperature range of the whole process by tapping the blue block temp range max block. Then by double tapping the PROCESS block we can set the starting value and the stopping value of the PID controller, cold water is the initial value of the temperature and hot water is the maximum set value of the temperature, and the last two options are for controlling the flow of water or oil as shown in figure ~\ref{fig:figure9}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{centering}

  \end{centering}
\end{figure}

We used real time pacer block to see the real time simulation of the whole process.

\vspace{3mm}
By starting simulation we can visualize the results graphs through scopes, the white scope shows the error i.e. the difference between the maximum range value and the cold water (initial value) of the cold fluid and the green scope shows how the temperature reaches its set point and stops the process of heating the oil furthermore shown in figure~\ref{fig:figure10}

\begin{figure}[H]

\newpage
\chapter{\textbf{Conclusion and Future Work}}

In this project, we have investigated and developed the idea of making a low cost and efficient system for the up gradation and digitization of this test bench. The main purpose of our project is to reduce human effort and we have made this system easier for the user to operate the machine, therefore every newbie can easily operate and control the machine’s system. In this machine we have used PID with touch buttons on the front panel with various functions. So after this up gradation there isn’t any need of a caretaker to stand in front of the machine all the time. The machine will simply stop the heater at the desired time and will blow an alarm or any indication light to inform the workers to proceed further with the lubrication process of the engine. 

\textbf{Future Developments:}

There is a possible chance of further development in the machine. So that we can improve the chances of more reliability and ease. 

\begin{itemize}
\item We can connect a GSM module using Arduino to control the machine with the computer using the internet technology. We can make a server for the machine which will directly connect the machine with the computer system and we can thus control the machine and quality of the output product by just one click

\item We can control the speed of the both motors, speed of the oil furnace, pressure of the oil pipes and load on the machine by up grading further it with the computer system using the modern techniques of the Arduino and FPGA.
